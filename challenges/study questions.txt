1. Describe the biggest difference between .forEach & .map.

.map returns a new array while .forEach doesn't. 

2. What is the difference between a function and a method? 

Function is an object. Method is a function that is also an object property. 

3. What is closure? Closure is code that's been identified elsewhere that can be used later and allows nested functions to use variable from above.

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.

Window/Global Object Binding - "this" is a window/console Object in global scope
Implicit Binding - Object before the dot is "this" when calling a function. 
New Binding - Refers to the specific instance of the object and is used in constructor function.
Explicit Binding - "this" is explicitly defined by using call, apply, bind. 

5.  Why do we need super() in an extended class? To inherit parent class's attributes.
